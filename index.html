        <h2> Introduction to the Multiverse theory. </h2>
        <p class="information">
            Though popularized by fictional works like Marvel and DC the idea of multiple universes has been around for centuries, and realistically the idea isn't actually that far fetched. With technological advances happening at insane rates, the theory becomes stronger by the day.

        <h2> Parental universes </h2>
        <p> The multiverse theory is split between theory crafters. That said, the one i personally find most likely is the idea of parent universes. This theory is based on the fact that we already have old universes which existed long before our own universe came to be. This theory can be backed up by other theories and hypothesis too, suggesting either technological advances from previous universes or random situasjons in that universe which creates a new one. </p>

        <h2> The big bang theory.  </h2>
        <p> To make sense out of the multiverse theory, we need to look at two other universally accepted theories which holds a strong scientific backing and evidentiality, starting with the Big Bang. The Big Bang is said to be the start of our universe. No matter which variant of the big bang you're viewing, that part is still the truth if you follow any scientific views of the Big Bang. Every single version of the Big Bang, has everything condensed in to the beginning. This gives our universe a starting point which then later "exploded" in a sence, which made the universe expand and become what our universe is today. As to why this is important for the multiverse theory, it basically shows that our universe has a simular beginning to animal births. More spesifically, the chicken and the egg. The universe also has a starting point which begs the question, what created the starting point? A possible answer to that is an event simular to black/white hole theories or something compleatly different. Still it carries a basis of multiple universes and a "Parent universe". </p>

    <h2> Evolution </h2>
    <p> Evolution has been shown countless times throught history, so refering to evolution as a theory at this point is a bit debatable. Regardless if you consider evolution as a theory or not, it's still the next important thing to know in order to understand the possability of the multiverse theory refrenced above. So what is evolution? In short it's something that changes throught time, becoming something new, and in most cases better. Evolution considers the evolvement spectrum whilst devolution is the opposit. Quickly mentioning that so that you know what we're talking about in this area, as we will focus on evolution. When it comes to the universe, it's ever expanding from the starting point of our universe. Why is this important? Just like living organisms like animals/plants etc.. the world also evolves naturally. This is important as it gives us a view into possabilities from other universes. The more something evolves the more "Improved" it becomes. What this means, is that situasjons can easily happen during evolution. When it comes to universal evolution, we've already seen things we never thought possible. so a white hole or something simular, created by evolutionarey events would be more then possible.
